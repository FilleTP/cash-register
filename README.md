## Description
- The app lets you add a set of products as line items to a cart.
- The app has a product index page, root
- The app has a cart show page
- The app calculates pricing discounts and sets a total price for the cart
- The app creates a new cart and stores the id in sessions, unless one exists already

## Models
### Product
- Associations: has_many :line_items
- Attributes: product_code (string), name (string), price (float)

## Tests
